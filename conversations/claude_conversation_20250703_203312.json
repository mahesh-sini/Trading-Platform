  "prompt": "my previous request broke due to token limits.  how do i continue now?  if i execute the command, the same issue is going to happen",
  "response": "You're right! Here are several strategies to handle the token limit issue:\n\n## Option 1: Process Files in Smaller Batches\n```bash\n# Process just a few files at a time\nfind /path/to/project -name \"*.py\" | head -5 | xargs ls -la\n\n# Then gradually increase or process different batches\nfind /path/to/project -name \"*.py\" | sed -n '6,10p' | xargs ls -la\n```\n\n## Option 2: Focus on Specific Areas\n```bash\n# Look at just the main directory structure first\nls -la /path/to/project/\n\n# Then dive into specific subdirectories\nls -la /path/to/project/src/\nls -la /path/to/project/tests/\n```\n\n## Option 3: Get a High-Level Overview First\n```bash\n# Show directory structure without file contents\ntree /path/to/project -I '__pycache__|*.pyc|.git'\n\n# Or just show Python files structure\nfind /path/to/project -name \"*.py\" -type f | head -20\n```\n\n## Option 4: Process One Key File at a Time\n```bash\n# Start with the most important file (like main.py, app.py, etc.)\ncat /path/to/project/main.py\n```\n\n**Which approach would you prefer?** Tell me:\n1. What's the main directory/project you're trying to analyze?\n2. What's your primary goal - understanding the structure, debugging, or something else?\n3. Are there specific files or areas you're most interested in?\n\nThis way we can tackle it systematically without hitting token limits."
