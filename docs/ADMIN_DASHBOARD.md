Create this admin dashboard as a separate application that integrates with the main trading platform backend. Include proper authentication, comprehensive logging, and ensure it follows the same security standards as the main platform. The admin panel should provide complete operational control over the SaaS platform while maintaining security and audit compliance.

## üîê CRITICAL: Default Admin Credentials

**‚ö†Ô∏è SECURITY ALERT ‚ö†Ô∏è**

The system automatically creates a Super Admin account during initial deployment:

```
Username: superadmin
Email: admin@tradingplatform.dev
Password: Admin123!@#ChangeMe
```

**üö® MANDATORY ACTIONS:**
1. **Change password immediately** after first login
2. **Enable MFA** for the super admin account
3. **Update email** to your actual admin email address
4. **Configure IP restrictions** for admin access
5. **Create additional admin users** and disable default account if needed

**Access URL:** `https://yourdomain.com/admin/login`

## üéõÔ∏è System Configuration Integration

The admin panel now includes a **System Configuration** section for centralized API management. This is the control center for all platform functionality.

### System APIs Required for Platform Operation

The following APIs must be configured for the platform to provide full functionality to users:

#### üìä Market Data APIs (Charts & Live Prices)
- **Alpha Vantage** (Recommended): Real-time quotes, historical data
- **Polygon.io** (Professional): Comprehensive market data
- **Yahoo Finance** (Free backup): Basic price feeds
- **NSE Official** (Indian markets): Live NSE/BSE data

#### ü§ñ AI/ML APIs (Predictions & Analysis)
- **OpenAI** (Recommended): Market analysis and predictions
- **Anthropic Claude**: Advanced market insights
- **Google AI**: Additional ML capabilities

#### üì∞ News & Sentiment APIs
- **News API**: Financial news and market sentiment
- **Twitter API**: Social sentiment analysis
- **Economic Times**: Indian market news

#### üìß Communication APIs
- **SendGrid**: Email notifications and alerts
- **Twilio**: SMS alerts and 2FA
- **AWS SES**: Alternative email service

### How System APIs Work

1. **Admin Configuration**: Admin enters API credentials in System Configuration panel
2. **Automatic Encryption**: All credentials stored encrypted in database
3. **Health Monitoring**: System continuously monitors API health
4. **Feature Activation**: Platform features automatically enable when APIs are healthy
5. **User Experience**: Users get charts, live prices, predictions without needing their own API keys

### User vs System APIs

**System APIs** (Configured by Admin):
- Market data for charts and prices
- AI services for predictions
- News feeds and sentiment analysis
- Email/SMS notification services
- ‚úÖ Used by platform for all users

**User APIs** (Provided by Individual Users):
- Zerodha, ICICI, Upstox trading credentials
- Individual broker API keys for trade execution
- ‚úÖ Used only for that user's trading operations

This separation ensures:
- Users don't need market data API keys
- Platform provides rich features out-of-the-box
- Trading remains secure and isolated per user
- Admin has full control over platform capabilities
